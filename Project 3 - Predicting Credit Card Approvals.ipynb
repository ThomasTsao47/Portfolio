Project Overview\n","<p>現代人向商業銀行申請信用卡似乎已成常態。然而，申請人可能因某些原因而被拒絕，例如不良貸款紀錄、低收入水平、有其他負債等。傳統利用人工查核的方式不僅容易出錯且耗時，還產生高額人力成本。如今，因科技的進步，使得很多商業銀行想要採用 <em>AI</em> 來實現信用卡審核自動化。因此，本專案將採用 <em>機器學習</em> 構建一個信用卡審核預測器，以滿足銀行需求。</p>\n","\n","<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_558/img/credit_card.jpg\" alt=\"Credit card being held in hand\"></p>\n","\n","<p>數據來源採用 UCI ML
